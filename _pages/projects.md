I extended a hybrid planning architecture, KAT, with explanation and online learning capabilities. The robot could answer human queries by tracing its beliefs and 'mental simulations' of counterfactual scenarios. By a combination of relational RL and decision tree induction, the robot could interactively learn unknown domain and task knowledge.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ecgan.gif){: .align-left}  **Expression-Conditioned GAN** 

I designed an expression-conditioned GAN for masked face inpainting. We embedded expression labels and employed two discriminators -- one for overall coherence, and another for the masked region. Our approach produced improved class separation among unmasked images, retaining facial context that other approaches did not.

We designed a MDP‑based solution for task allocation, system management, low‑level actuation, and collision avoidance in a simulated restaurant environment with robot
waiters. We implemented a dynamic ordering module to simulate different demand periods for the restaurant, determining the optimal number of robots to minimize business expense and maintain customer satisfaction.
