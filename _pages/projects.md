![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/exp-resize.gif){: .align-left}  **Explainable Planning and Interactive Learning** 

I extended a hybrid planning architecture, KAT, with explanation and online learning capabilities. The robot could answer human queries by tracing its beliefs and 'mental simulations' of counterfactual scenarios. By a combination of relational RL and decision tree induction, the robot could interactively learn unknown domain and task knowledge.
