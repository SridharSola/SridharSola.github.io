    alt: "AWS app demo"
    title: "Explainable Robots with Online Learning"
    text: "I extended a hybrid planning architecture, KAT, with explanation and online learning capabilities. The robot could answer human queries by tracing its beliefs and 'mental simulations' of counterfactual scenarios. By a combination of relational RL and decision tree induction, the robot could interactively learn unknown domain and task knowledge. I then demonstrated that online learning improved the robot's plans through improved explanations. I also discussed a philosophical grounding of 'explanation' in my thesis."
